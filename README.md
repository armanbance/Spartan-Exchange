# Spartan-Fitness
Spartan Fitness is a site for SJSU students to track how crowded the school gym is, and make fitness plans based on available machines. 
We collect data from SerpApi and from San Jose State to assign a busyness score depending on the current time and day.
Users are also able to build custom workout plans to help achieve all of their fitness goals!
