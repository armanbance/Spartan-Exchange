        <p className="text-3xl mt-72 text-slate-50">Spartan Fitness is a website that helps users 
        optimize their workouts by providing real-time data to track how busy the Spartan Recreation and Aquatic Center (SRAC) is. Leveraging the power of SerpAPI 
        and Google Maps, Spartan Fitness offers 
        detailed information on busy times and predicts current gym occupancy. We also track whenever events are happening and inform users if it is more crowded than usual.</p>
